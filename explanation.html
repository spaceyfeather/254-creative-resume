            <h1>RPV</h1>
            <p>I have 5 years of experience creating art independently, primarily digital. Programs I've used include
                Colors!3D, Medibang Paint Pro, FireAlpaca, Inkscape, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I also have roughly a
                decade of music experience, with piano, cello, and flute for 10, 8, and 7 years respectively. I've only
                been learning HTML and CSS for a semester but have picked up a lot. I include my experiences with
                ASD/ADHD and coming out as LGBTQIA+, as it is its own experience and deeply influences what I
                do.
                <br>&emsp; It's easier for me to complete a task if I know every aspect of it, so when working in groups
                I usually take a leadership position, though I work best independently where I can have full control of
                what happens. I work most efficiently with a well-structured list of what needs to be done. I can pick
                up step-based tasks and recreate them easily.
                <br>&emsp; Mental health is important to consider as it is something I have constantly struggled with.
                Balancing factors like sensory needs are what keep me able to work. Respecting people no matter their
                workflows, identities, and needs is important as well. I also find clear and concise communication
                vital to understanding something, as it can be easy to misinterpret or overthink.
            </p>

            <h1>Creative Process</h1>
            <p>The first draft of this project was a simple layout on a letterhead as I wasn't sure yet what to do.
                Iteration is rather difficult for me, as I try to get things right the first time around. I tried using
                fonts that resembled my handwriting for my name, but eventually gave up and wrote it in Photoshop. Once
                I realized that making a website was a viable option, I switched to that, as it's easier for me to
                manage
                than an Illustrator file.
                <br>&emsp; The website format allows me to showcase more of my art, and I went with a color scheme that
                more
                suits my favorite colors (namely letting the boxes be gray instead of going all teal). I found a clean
                cursive font that reminded me of my handwriting, and then went with the usual sans serif header and
                serif text to make it look more professional and easier to read. I put the Resources and
                Processes lists together so that the image wouldn't cause too much white space.
                <br>&emsp; My first draft also had clipart of the rainbow infinity symbol used to represent autism, but
                it felt
                wrong to use an asset I didn't create, and its coloring made it stand out more than I wished. (I suppose
                I was able to still have that representation with the fact all of the artwork I chose is pokemon
                related. I've used that background image for a handful of projects with the same purpose, so it gave me
                a sense of consistency.)
